          <p> I am inspired by work that creates change, brings opportunities for personal growth, empathetic to the needs of the community, and brings people together.

Other interest include:
Programming
The intersection between Education and Technology.
Social Responsibility and Community Outreach. In the fall of 2009 I entered San Francisco State University as a Mathematics Education Major. During my undergrad studies, my general education requirement exposed me to many different areas and sparked a lot different interest. I was exposed to many different departments that were Languages, Art, Sexual Education, Women and Gender Studies, Sociology, and Politic Science. While getting exposed to many fields, my interest of study started to shift and I realized not only my love for the Science and Education but also for Ethnic Studies. During my undergrad I made the hard choice of changing my Mathematics Education Major to a double major in Latina/o Studies and Spanish. Although it was a tough decision, I  still kept true to my interest of Science and Education through my personal time.

In the year if 2013-2014, I was given the opportunity to study abroad and live in Spain for the academic year. While in Spain I was able to sharpen my syntax and phonetics for Spanish and pick up some French. However, the benefits of living abroad where immense, and my love for traveling and getting to know new cultures thrived.  During my time at SFSU, I was also a coordinator for La Raza Student Organization, representative for the Latinos Unidos Coalition on behalf of L.R.S.O., and member of CSU IP. As I finished up my undergrad at SFSU, I received a double major in Latina/o Studies and Spanish Language and Literature in May 2015.

In 2012, I volunteered and work with a Non-Profit named Jamestown Community Center at Cesar Chavez Elementary School as a 2nd Grade Teacher. While working at Jamestown I was able to learn the intersections of many social issues that crossed paths and affect unrepresentative communities of Mission District, predominately the Latino Community. I was able to put my studies to practice and try to make as much impact as possible by developing lesson plans catered to the multicultural students.</p>
