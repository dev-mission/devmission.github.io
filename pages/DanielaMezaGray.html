          <h3> Daniela is currently the Program Coordinator of the Volunteer Legal Services Corporation in Oakland, a nonprofit dedicated to improving access to justice to the low-income residents of Alameda County. As a first generation college graduate and DACA recipient, Daniela has a strong commitment to facilitating and creating pathways for low-income diverse communities to succeed in education and in the workforce.
</br></br>
Previous to her role at VLSC, Daniela worked for the Pomona College Academy for Youth Success, a college access program committed to increasing the number of students from low-income and historically underrepresented backgrounds in highly selective colleges and universities. Through her personal experience and work with low-income and minority communities, Daniela has seen the limitless potential of diverse communities when given the tools and opportunities to succeed. She hopes to one day lead diversity initiatives for tech companies that are ready to invest in the infrastructure necessary to recruit and retain the most talented and diverse candidates in our communities.  </h3>
