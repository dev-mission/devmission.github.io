          <p>Originally from Houston, Texas, Jesse found his way to San Francisco in March 1997 where he

first experienced what it meant to work for a startup. As employee 27, he got to see firsthand the

building of a Silicon Valley company (funded by Sequoia Capital) that ultimately grew into a

thousand employee+ corporation all in less than a year as it was acquired for $180 million by

Frontier Communications. <br><br>

That experience and access to his new mentors/advisors, led Jesse to cofound along with his

brother in 1998 one of the first U.S. online bilingual Latino communities (Picosito.com) which was

recognized by a U.S. Congressional Record by the House of Representatives in 1999 for their

efforts around technology in Latino Community. They raised $2.3 million in seed capital and had

two acquisition offers in less than six months.<br><br>

After the dot com era, Jesse went back to Corporate America; he has over 10 years in the BPM

industry & has worked with industry leaders such as Xerox Global Services, IKON, & Kofax as a

Business Development Manager. He was also the cofounder of his 2nd startup – Giggo, a

groupon-like venture delivering their messaging all in Spanish. Previously, he was the

cofounder/COO of his third startup - Relevance, which took him to Brazil as the country director

under the Startup Brasil Program.<br><br>

Jesse is the Cofounder of AVION Ventures which is the 1st pre-accelerator focused on Latina

women working on mobile ventures and based in San Francisco. His other personal passion is

the Latino Startup Alliance, a non-profit supporting global Latino Tech Entrepreneurs and startup

ecosystems where he serves as the Cofounder | Co-chair. He is also the Cofounder and Co-chair

for the 1st Americas Summit – Bridging the Americas and SF/Silicon Valley.

Currently, Jesse is the first Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) for Salesforce Incubator working on

a new venture at the intersection of Capital + Diverse Founders + Impact.<br><br>

Lastly, Jesse was also the Cofounder of Spark America (Intro to tech entrepreneurship @ Mission

High School), a program where he volunteered his time in teaching tech entrepreneurship to youth

attending Mission High School (SFUSD). The program started as an after school pilot after seeing

the disparity between the Mission Neighborhood and the Tech ecosystem. Just after one

semester, the Youth Startups program turned to a class elective for credit and Jesse along with

his brother taught for two semesters by volunteering their time to this important initiative. </p>
