                        <p class="p-font1 text-left">Are you interested in tech? Do you enjoy coding, but don't know where to start? Well, there is a huge gap connecting young adults to tech opportunities in San Francisco, Bay Area and Beyond; and only 16% of high school seniors want to pursue STEM careers. To fix the gap between diversity in tech, untapped young adults need to be exposed to IT fields, need to be inspired by adults to whom they can relate, educated in both Technical and Soft Skills, and Empowering them to land a career in Tech.
                            <strong>&lt;dev/Mission&gt;</strong> will close that gap by connecting tech companies; their employees and participants to corporate site visits, a mentorship model and internship/apprenticeship opportunities. Do you want to change your life? Do you want to start a career in the Tech Industry?
