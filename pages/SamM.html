          <p> I am originally from Fresno, then went to Pennsylvania and played D1 baseball at Bucknell University from 2000-2004. My wife and I met while living in Baltimore, then we moved to San Francisco in 2008. <br><br>

Ever since graduating college, I’ve been involved in real estate in one way or another. Before joining Mission Housing, I managed real estate assets for union pension funds and various union locals throughout Northern California. I started with Mission Housing in December 2011 as an Asset Manager, then Director of Asset Management and became Executive Director in September 2013. <br><br>

I oversee the administration of all Mission Housing assets, programs and services. I also make sure that each and every day our mission, and the short and long term vision for Mission Housing are achieved. Every day is different! I am often in meetings at City Hall and throughout various San Francisco communities pushing for more support of the Affordable Housing industry. On other days, my time at Mission Housing might be spent with issues like human resources, operations, budgets or board meetings. <br><br>

Working in Affordable Housing is very rewarding, and I’m very thankful for finding Mission Housing. The most satisfying part of my job is watching our employees represent Mission Housing in the community, interacting with and supporting our residents and our neighbors in the Mission. Since 2012, our staff has grown from eight people to 25 people! Seeing how we can make change for the better is very gratifying. <br><br>

I love working on behalf of the current and future residents of the Mission. The people before me who paved the way for Mission Housing sacrificed a great deal. I’m reminded of their hard work whenever I look at one of our 35 buildings, or meet one of our residents.</p>
