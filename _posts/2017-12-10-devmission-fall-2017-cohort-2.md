dev/Mission’s Fall 2017 Cohort # 2 Program launched 8 weeks ago in partnership with Mission Housing Development Corporation inside Valencia Gardens in San Francisco, CA.

The 12 weeks intensive technology program started back on Monday September 25th, and currently has 10 young adults ages 16-24 enrolled in the program. Most of the young adults come from low income communities in San Francisco, Bayview, Visitacion Valley and the Mission district and about 80% of the students are Hispanic descendant. The average income level for their families is between $30,000 and $40,000.

This FREE program offers IT essential training in hardware/tech support/CompTIA, Intro to Programming (HTML, CSS and Javascript) and Critical Career Skills to underserved young adults. Our schedule is three days a week for 3 hours a day and on Fridays we dedicate that day for corporate site visits. Most of the program participants did not know what to expect in the program; but they were mostly interested in technology skills.

During the past 8 weeks, the participants have been able to put together components of a computer independently, install software, learn about network essentials, and crimp cables. They have also learn how to create an elevator pitch; a full blown skill chart; created their resume and a LinkedIn profile. As of today they are working on getting their own personal website up and running from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They will present their websites @ the Graduation on Friday December 15th, 2017.

One of the most innovative competencies that we have developed this Fall is that we launched an IoT curriculum in partnership with Particle for Good thanks to Melissa Powell that is allowing our students to be introduced to IoT concepts. We will be launching a full blown curriculum for the next Spring 2018 cohort.


We have visited a few tech companies in the past eight weeks: Dropbox, Jones IT, Square, Autodesk & UBER. These field trips to different tech companies are beneficial to our students. The students are be able to learn from these unique tech companies’ environments and interview current employees about their experiences and paths.

The dev/Mission program often invites guest speakers from different technology corporations to speak to the students about their experiences and share some advice with them. Many students have found the speaker's experiences interesting and motivating; another great way to teach them how to network with peers and colleagues.

We are also very excited to launch our 2nd "Tech Wizard" Mentorship program that will provide a 6 month mentorship program to these graduates working together with their mentor to identify career pathways and other tech opportunities.

The next 4 weeks are going to be exciting as these untapped young adults are beginning to identify which career pathway they would like to follow: post secondary education or employment pathways. dev/Mission will be there to support their career pathway for months/years to come!
