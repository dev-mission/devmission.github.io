FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>

Opportunities for All (OFA) Kick Off

On Monday June 17th, 2019 our organization kicked off the Opportunities<br>
for All (OFA) Summer Internship Program.<br><br>

The Opportunities for All project will place low-income and underserved<br>
high-school aged youth in summer STEM internships, building critical career<br>
skills, increasing knowledge of STEM concepts, and providing on-the-job experience <br>
that is transferable to future education and career pathways.<br><br>

The project is a partnership between Opportunities for All, Microsoft,<br>
LinkedIn, Uber the City of San Francisco Mayor’s Office, and our organization.<br><br>

Youth from various SF High Schools will have the opportunity for an internship<br>
this summer with our organization. Internships will vary from social media, <br>
data entry, admin assistant, blogger, Microsoft Projects, LinkedIn, outreach <br>
and helping out in our STEAM Hub. Youth will be placed in the different communities<br>
that we serve: Mission,Western Addition, Bayview Hunters Point and Visitacion Valley.<br><br>

Opportunities for All (OFA) provides access to career exploration and workforce<br>
development for San Francisco’s youth and young adults. The initiative includes <br>
paid internships, mentorship, and pathways to employment, including job readiness,<br>
career training, and apprenticeship for participants ages 13-24. OFA focuses on<br>
equitable access to these opportunities through workforce connection, support <br>
job resources for both job seekers and employers.<br><br>

“I’m excited to start my Opportunities for All (OFA) internship with <strong>&lt;dev/Mission&gt;</strong><br> I am looking forward to being the Microsoft/LinkedIn Blogger Intern.<br>
I am thankful for London Breed and Balboa SF STEM Academy for this <br>
