On Monday June 5th, 2017, dev/Mission hosted an orientation for the summer 2017 dev/Mission pilot program. Twenty-two carefully selected participants came to the computer lab at Valencia Gardens, a 100 percent affordable apartment complex owned by Mission Housing Development Corporation.

Marcia Contreras, Director of Operations & Resident Operations & Resident Services for Mission Housing spoke about the collaboration between dev/Mission and Mission Housing and how excited they are about connecting more affordable housing young adults to our program inside Valencia Gardens.

The orientation gave attendees an overview of what they will learn, and what they can expect to happen after completing the program. The participants were very excited to be part of our first ever cohort! Their enthusiastic questions sought specifics about the curriculum, teaching styles and the competencies of the instructors. All the participants were also interviewed by dev/Mission and Mission Housing staff.

The orientation wrapped-up with an ice breaker, where the students shared how completing the program could further their career interests. We were really happy with the diversity of the group: young adults from all over the bay area and different walks of life. Some of the young adults that are participating in our pilot program have CS degrees; others have never worked with computers before!

One of the young girls that is participating mentioned during her intro that the reason why she joined dev/Mission is because there are no programs like this in her community.

All the young people who attended the orientation are motivated to become success stories, and join the "next generation of tech talent".

The dev/Mission summer program runs June 12th through August 17th. The intensive ten week session will introduce these young adults to hardware, intro to programming and critical career skills. The students will connect to opportunities for careers in tech, after graduating the program.
