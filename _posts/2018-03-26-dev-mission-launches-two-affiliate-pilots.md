I am very excited to announce that Dev Mission has launched two new affiliates pilots in partnership with San Francisco Housing Development Corporation and COIT this Spring.

The City and County of San Francisco’s Digital Equity (COIT) initiative is a collaborative effort to ensure all city residents are able to access and effectively use technology essential in today’s world. Mr. Alexander Banh has been working with me for the past 6 months to identify the need for a STEM CS Program in two underserved communities in San Francisco.

We are excited to announce that two of our pilot program launched in two affordable housing communities: Bayview Hunters Point West and Robert B Pitts in the Western Addition. We have been working really hard with Mike Yoshioka and Danielle Banks to make sure this model works for both communities as well.

The 12 weeks Spring 2018 STEM CS intensive technology program started back on February 12th, @ the Western Addition and it has 6 young adults enrolled in our program, the Bayview Hunters Point West started back on Tuesday, February 27th and it currently has 4 students enrolled.

This FREE program offers IT essential training in hardware/tech support and after they complete the program they will pursue the A+ PC Certification Exam, they are also being introduced to coding by learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Another competency they are being exposed is Critical Career Skills to help them prepare for careers in tech thru post-secondary or employment pathways.


All of the young adults come from those low-income communities; 100% are African American from the Western Addition affiliate site and 80% are Latina from the Bayview Hunters Point West Affiliate Site. The average income level for their families is between $30,000 and $40,000. Also very excited to share that we have about 70% young girls enrolled from both sites.

During the past 6 weeks, the participants have been able to put together components of a computer independently. As of today, they are working on getting their own personal website up and running from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


The next 6 weeks are going to be exciting as these two groups will start providing FREE Tech Support services to the low-income families living in these two communities and help them how to connect to the neighborhood Wi-Fi provided by the Mayor’s Office!

I want to take this moment to also acknowledge two of our staff that are making this happen for both program affiliates: Zuri Gonzalez and John Affolter and our volunteer Mari Medrano as well. These EDTechs are helping these young adults learn all of our competencies but above all they are a role model for these young people enrolled in our affiliate sites.

We are creating the next generation of tech talent out of Bayview Hunters Point West and The Western Addition in San Francisco.
