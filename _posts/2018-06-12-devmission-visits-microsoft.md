Our Summer 2018 Cohort was invited for a corporate site visit to Microsoft HQ in San Francisco, CA on Tuesday June 12th, 2018.

Melinda Anderson, Business Operations & Community Manager for Microsoft welcomed our cohort with a big smile! Students were very surprised for her to make those remarks, as they should be the ones thanking her for the amazing opportunity. 

We were also greeted later on in a conference room by Sara, Felix, and Chris (Microsoft Employees) who gave an in-depth explanation on career success and gracious to share their personal struggles (e.g. mental health, learning and relearning concepts, and their education) to become who they are today. This diversity career panel was the highlight of the day as our students learned how they can also pursue the same career path.

Our students also received training on how to use LinkedIn. Cara gave a good impromptu explanation about LinkedIn, which was a very informative session.

The corporate site visit ended up by having Melinda provide some tasty pizza for our students after a wonderful event.

We would like to thank Microsoft for being our funder but also for believing in how we are creating the next generation of tech talent.
