<br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>

<br>January 25th, 2019<br/>
<br>Uber Forges Major Partnerships with Local Organizations to Help Expand Access to High Quality Job Opportunities
Commits $300,000, office space and volunteers for 2019 among local nonprofits DevMission, Code Tenderloin and Opportunities for All.<br/>

<br>San Francisco - January 23, 2019 - Today, Uber announced that it is commiting more than $300,000 in 2019 to help organizations across San Francisco increase access to high quality job opportunities. Beyond the financial commitment, Uber is donating office space and providing volunteers to help train the next generation of technology leaders, and is offering ride credits to help additional organizations provide crucial services to residents in need.<br/>

<br>As part of the commitment, Uber is donating $100,000 each to three different local organizations including DevMission, Code Tenderloin and Opportunities for All. Uber released the grants in January 2019. The donations build on long-standing relationships Uber has established with each of these organizations that date back to their founding days.<br>

<br>Launched in 2017, DevMission helps prepare young adults ages 16-24 for careers in technology by creating apprenticeship programs with local tech companies. Since it launched, Uber has worked with it to host weekly “Open Labs”, where Uber engineers mentor young adults for two hours every Tuesday, answering questions about coding and software development. The labs started at Uber’s offices before moving to DevMission’s headquarters in Summer 2017. Uber has also hosted three corporate visits from DevMission students, where its engineers and lawyers have answered questions about working in tech and provided guidance on how to break into the field. DevMission will use the grant from Uber to add an additional 30 students to the program as well as an additional 10 new internships, and purchase equipment for its students to use.<br>

<br>These partnerships build on work that Uber has engaged in across the Bay Area to improve access to food and healthcare for residents in need. For example, Uber has given ride credits to a variety of organizations across the Bay Area, including including Family House, San Francisco AIDS Foundation and more. Family House, a recipient of Uber’s 2017 Community Credits program, used the credits to book rides for the 80 families that stay with them, many of whom can’t take public transportation to go between appointments; while San Francisco AIDS Foundation enrolled in Uber Health and continue to use their credits as a way to get their clients to and from medical and housing appointments.<br/>
