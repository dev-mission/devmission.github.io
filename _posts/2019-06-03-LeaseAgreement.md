(SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.) — One of the premier Resident Services collaborations in San Francisco is<br>
taking another step forward. On June 3, 2019, two years after agreeing to partner and incubate at<br>

lease agreement with the nonprofit developer making Valencia Gardens, located at 360 Valencia St., <br>
the official headquarters of the tech nonprofit.

"When we incubated dev/Mission two years ago, we could only dream that Leo and his team would<br>
reward our faith the way that they have,” said Sam Moss, Executive Director at Mission Housing. “We're<br>
beyond proud of dev/Mission's success. They're further proof that Mission Housing's commercial<br>
tenants thrive when they’re truly community partners, and we'll continue to support these invaluable<br>
assets to our communities because that is the Mission Housing way."<br>

Mission Housing and dev/Mission are pleased to extend an invitation to the public on June 3, 2019 for<br>
the official ribbon cutting ceremony at the official headquarters of dev/Mission — 360 Valencia St. <br>

together with our leadership team to develop this amazing lease that will help us enhance and deliver<br>
programming in the Mission District for years to come,” said Leo Sosa, Executive Director of &lt;dev/Mission&gt;<br>

said Marcia Contreras, Deputy Executive Director at Mission Housing. “Mission Housing is thrilled to be able <br>
to secure a space for dev/Mission, but most importantly what this space represents to so many young adults. <br>
We believed in the vision that Leo Sosa presented to us two years ago. Today, we celebrate a mutual <br> 
collaboration that has produced opportunities to so many, but most importantly it has empowered our young <br>
adults to believe in themselves and become our future
