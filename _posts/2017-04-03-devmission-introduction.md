April 3rd, 2017

I am writing you today to introduce you to an organization called Dev Mission. Dev Mission® was founded in early 2017 by myself and a team of technologists that care about STEM opportunities for diverse San Franciscan young adults. Our goal is to connect the most overlooked population in San Francisco, Bay Area and beyond and expose them to pursue careers in the tech industry.

There is a noticeable gap in technology career opportunities for young adults from diverse communities such as internships, apprenticeships, and jobs. To fix the gap between diversity in tech, diverse young adults need to be exposed to careers in IT. They need to be inspired by adults to whom they can relate, educated in both technical and critical skills; and empowering them to continue their post-secondary education and land a career/job of their choice.

Dev Mission is a new best practice, diverse young adults workforce development movement that engages affordable housing young adults ages 16-24, in hardware, coding and critical "soft skills".

Dev Mission will close that gap by connecting tech companies and participants to corporate site visits, mentorship models and apprenticeship positions. We are committed to ensure that our diverse young adults ages 16-24 enrolled in our program will receive the necessary support to pursue careers in tech.

We will connect participants to apprenticeships, internships, job shadowing opportunities, mentors and scholarships to pursue careers in tech. With your support Dev Mission will help to close one of the most challenging gaps in today’s information technology sectors.

Over the next 12 months, Dev Mission will provide training and technical support to 50 affordable housing young adults ages 16-24 that are interested in careers in the tech industry. In order to achieve these goals, we must first identify and define the needs of our funding requirements and support.

As the Dev Mission’s Executive Director, I am writing today to request your support to help us continue to expand on my 15 year experience in youth development; and professional training in information technology. As Dev Mission’s Executive Director I have a background in developing three successful vocational programs for youth/young adults in technology since 1995:

YouthNet, SF, MLVS(1995 - 2000) connecting 300 San Francisco Middle/High School Youth to technology skills;
Digital Connectors, One Economy Corp (2013 - 2010) connecting more than 1,000 youth ages 14-17 to leadership and technology opportunities in 15 cities across the country;
Mission Techies, SF MEDA (2014-2017) connecting more than 150 young adults ages 17-24 to careers in tech with close to 100 of 145 graduates working in IT entry level jobs with an average wage of $22.00/hr.
We also have tech companies employees from various tech companies to support the program’s pilot and to volunteer as tech mentors for the young adults ages 16-24 enrolled in our program.

Finally, Dev Mission has established an IT Leadership Committee (Team) with the primary objective of engaging local tech companies that are passionate about diversity in the Tech Sector to provide graduates of the Dev Mission program with internships/apprenticeships and employment opportunities. Also this Leadership Committee will meet on a quarterly basis to ensure Dev Mission's Mission, Vision, Values and direct service impact is being delivered. Dev Mission Leadership Team will work along Dev Mission Executive Director to ensure he receives the necessary feedback and support to carry out Dev Mission’s program goals and outcomes.
