FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>

Jul 15th, 2019<br>


Opportunities for All creates access for diverse young people<br> 
to employment around San Francisco. The program includes paid<br>
internships, mentorship, career training, and apprenticeship<br>
for participants ages 13 to 24. This was <strong>&lt;dev/Mission&gt;</strong>’s first<br>
year partnering up with Opportunities for All to provide paid<br>
internships to young people from different high schools around<br>
San Francisco. <strong>&lt;dev/Mission&gt;</strong> is extremely thankful to have these<br>
amazing interns this summer. <br><br>

<strong>&lt;dev/Mission&gt;</strong> provided a various amount of internships this summer<br>
like outreach, data entry, admin assistant, photographer, blogger,<br>
and marketing. Everyone was consistently busy and learning everyday<br>
with their supervisors. We faced a countless amount of challenges<br>
and learned many career skills, communication skills, and problem<br>
solving skills.<br><br>

Once again, <strong>&lt;<strong>&lt;dev/Mission&gt;</strong>&gt;</strong> was pleased to have interns this summer and<br>
we can’t wait to see what happens next year. The interns did great<br>
this summer! <br><br>


An OFA Participant states, “I would like to thank Opportunities<br>
for All and <strong>&lt;dev/Mission&gt;</strong> for my internship this summer. I was a<br>
Blogger at <strong>&lt;dev/Mission&gt;</strong> and I also did data entry. I have learned<br>
so much this summer and I can’t thank them enough! It’s been so <br>
much fun."<br><br>
