FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>

<br>May 23rd, 2019<br>

On Thursday, May 23rd, 2019 inside the Robert B Pitts Public Housing Complex and<br>
in partnership with FRH Consulting our <strong>&lt;dev/Mission&gt;</strong> Community came together to celebrate <br>
the accomplishments of 6 young adults from the western addition as they completed an 8-week<br> 
training pre-apprenticeship occupational skills program; the program has prepared them for <br>
careers in the tech sector as well as post-secondary educational programs.<br><br>

In partnership with FRH Consulting, Danielle Banks and Evie Barranco, we provided technology<br>
instruction to 6 transitional-age youth, ages 16-24 since February 2019, in the following competencies:<br>

<strong>A+ Training</strong>: 1st crucial step to advance IT Certifications.<br>
<strong>Intro to Programming</strong>: Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as youth build their own website, web app or mobile app.<br>
<strong>Critical Career Skills</strong>: Youth learn about Job Readiness, business communication, professionalism, and team building projects.<br><br>

The program is unique in that instruction takes place exclusively onsite in affordable housing<br> communities in San Francisco, and youth participants are required to provide much-needed free <br>
tech support and repair services to low-income families in their communities when they graduate<br>
from their program.<br><br>

The graduation was an opportunity to honored students for their hard work in the presence of their<br> families and friends. Speakers included partners from the tech industry, Office of Economic and<br> Workforce Development (TechSF) and members of the graduation class and their families.<br><br>

To learn more about <strong>&lt;dev/Mission&gt;</strong> which aims to train untapped young adults ages 16-24 for careers<br>
