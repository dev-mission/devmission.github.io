Dev Mission began by supporting myself; when I met Leo I wasn’t sure what would happen next, but I was nervously excited! I had left my job and I was destined to find a new path in life. After our second conversation, we both had something in common, elevating the youth to better opportunities. At this point, I am supporting the organization as the program coordinator and I intend on moving up with the organization. I have also been able to reference family members to the program so they too can learn new skills and apply them. Finally, being a single mother has been a long journey with hopes of success in the near future, luckily I am able to share those moments of greatness like the Inaugural graduation and a newly titled position with my daughter.

I am hoping to receive my CompTIA certification 2018 and continue to learn Python and other coding languages.

The hustle to get the youth were we really want to be and the extensive support from the entire organization.
