Its with a great pleasure to announce that in partnership with Mission Housing Development Corporation a nonprofit, community-based organization creating and preserving high-quality affordable housing, and providing supportive services for residents of low and moderate incomes in the Mission District and throughout San Francisco we will run our 1st pilot summer program intensive. Our summer program is schedule to start on Monday June 5th with a program orientation and will run all the way to August 17th, 2017. The program will run on Monday, Tuesday and Thursdays from 4pm - 7pm and open lab activities on Fridays.

I am very excited to come back to Mission Housing and Valencia Gardens, I ran a similar program back in 2018–2011 called “Digital Connectors”. After I left Mission Housing I knew I will comeback to potentially run a similar program. 

During the beginning of this year I had a meeting with Sam Moss who’s Mission Housing Executive Director, and Marcia Contreras Director of Operations & Resident Services to discuss housing dev/Mission @ Valencia Gardens and that’s how the partnership began. Mission Housing became our 1st non-profit partner in the Mission District and we are very delighted to potentially be able to connect their young adults to our program and careers in tech.

This summer intensive will focus on three competencies: 

1. Hardware (CompTIA) This certification validates understanding of the most common hardware and software technologies in business and certifies the skills necessary to support complex IT infrastructures. CompTIA A+ is a powerful credential that helps IT professionals worldwide ignite their IT career.

2. Intro to Programming (HTML, CSS and Java Script) programming route will primarily focus on teaching young adults the foundation and fundamentals of coding to prepare them for careers as Web or Mobile Developers. Our curriculum will focus on a combination of reading documentation and code, hands on coding, debugging code, white boarding and a mix of algorithms.

3. Critical Career Skills: Our program will focus on preparing youth and young adults to prepare for careers/jobs with a full blown curriculum focusing on the following lessons: networking meetups, business communication, team building projects, professionalism, create their digital portfolio, job readiness, interview skills and how to prepare for a job interview in IT.
