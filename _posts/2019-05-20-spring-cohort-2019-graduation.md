FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>


May 20, 2019<br>

On Friday, May 3rd, @ the Google Launchpad in SF our &lt;dev/Mission&gt; Community came together to celebrate the<br> accomplishments of 6 young adults from SF as the completed a 12-week training pre-apprenticeship occupational<br>
skills program; the program has prepared them for careers in the tech sector.<br>

In partnership with Mission Housing Development Corporation, we provided technology instruction to 6 transitional-age<br>
youth, ages 16-24 since February 2019, in the following competencies:<br>

A+ Training: 1st crucial step to advance IT Certifications.<br>
IoT: Internet of Things where youth learn how to build hardware/coding projects with electronics, sensors, led lights<br>
and much more.<br>
Intro to Programming: Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as youth build their own website, web app or mobile app.<br>
Critical Career Skills: Youth learn about Job Readiness, business communication, professionalism, and team building<br>
projects.<br>

The program is unique in that instruction takes place exclusively onsite in affordable housing communities in <br>San Francisco, and youth participants are required to provide much-needed free tech support and repair services to <br>
low-income families in their communities when they graduate from their program.<br>

The graduation was an opportunity to honored students for their hard work in the presence of their families and<br> friends. Speakers included partners from the tech industry and members of the graduation class, and internship placements
were also be announced.<br>
