FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

OEWD TechSF Apprenticeship Announcement
When: Thursday, November 15th, 2018
Where: <dev/Mission> HQ (360 Valencia Street)
Time: 4:00pm - 5:00pm

Please join us to celebrate the announcement and official launch of our Tech Wizard Apprenticeship Training Program.

<dev/Mission> will be participating in the celebration of National Apprenticeship Week, November 12-16, 2018. Registered apprenticeships in the tech sector are growing, but largely underutilized. In an effort to close the skills gap and strengthen the pipeline for participants to enter the tech sector, TechSF has selected our organization to deliver Occupational Skills Training through our 12 Week Pre-Apprenticeship Program. 

<dev/Mission> brings diversity and a strong technical training to the TechSF portfolio. Our organization will be featured on Thursday, November 15th @ our Headquarters (360 Valencia) during a focused event that showcases both the excellent skill set of their trainees and the diversity within their programming. 

Beyond showcasing <dev/Mission> talent, <dev/Mission> will be launching the official Tech Wizard Apprenticeship Training program with Office of Economic and Workforce Development, Mission Housing Development Corporation, Apprenticeship Employers and our alumni and current participants showcasing their work!

To learn more about <dev/Mission> which aims to train untapped young adults ages 16-24 for careers in tech, and to participate on this event please contact Leo Sosa @ leo@devmission.org
