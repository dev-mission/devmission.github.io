On Friday December 7th, 2018 @ the Google Community Space in SF our <dev/Mission> Community came together to celebrate the accomplishments of 10 young adults from SF and the Bay Area as they completed a 12-week training program; the program has prepared them for careers in the tech sector. 

In partnership with Mission Housing Development Corporation, we provided technology instruction to 10 transitional-age youth, ages 16-24, in the following competencies:

-A+ Training: 1st crucial step to advance IT Certifications
-IoT: Internet of Things where youth learn how to build hardware/coding projects with electronics, sensors, led lights and much more
-Intro to Programming: Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as youth build their own website, web app or mobile app.
-Critical Career Skills: Youth learn about Job Readiness, business communication, professionalism, and team building projects.

The program is unique in that instruction takes place exclusively onsite in affordable housing communities in San Francisco, and youth participants are required to provide much-needed free tech support and repair services to low-income families in their communities when they graduate from their program.

The graduation was an opportunity to honored 10 students for their hard work in the presence of their families and friends. Speakers included partners from the tech industry and members of the graduation class, and internship placements were also be announced.
