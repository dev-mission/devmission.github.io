As employee 27, he got to see firsthand the building of a Silicon Valley company (funded by Sequoia Capital) that ultimately grew into a thousand employee+ corporation all in less than a year as it was acquired for $180 million by Frontier Communications. <br> That experience and access to his new mentors/advisors, led Jesse to cofound along with his brother in 1998 one of the first U.S. online bilingual Latino communities (Picosito.com) which was recognized by a U.S. Congressional Record by the House of Representatives in 1999 for their efforts around technology in Latino Community. They raised $2.3 million in seed capital and had two acquisition offers in less than six months.<br> After the dot com era, Jesse went back to Corporate America; he has over 10 years in the BPM industry & has worked with industry leaders such as Xerox Global Services, IKON, & Kofax as a Business Development Manager. He was also the cofounder of his 2nd startup – Giggo, a groupon-like venture delivering their messaging all in Spanish. Previously, he was the cofounder/COO of his third startup - Relevance, which took him to Brazil as the country director under the Startup Brasil Program.<br> Jesse is the Cofounder of AVION Ventures which is the 1st pre-accelerator focused on Latina women working on mobile ventures and based in San Francisco. His other personal passion is the Latino Startup Alliance, a non-profit supporting global Latino Tech Entrepreneurs and startup ecosystems where he serves as the Cofounder | Co-chair. He is also the Cofounder and Co-chair for the 1st Americas Summit – Bridging the Americas and SF/Silicon Valley. Currently, Jesse is the first Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) for Salesforce Incubator working on a new venture at the intersection of Capital + Diverse Founders + Impact.<br> Lastly, Jesse was also the Cofounder of Spark America (Intro to tech entrepreneurship @ Mission High School), a program where he volunteered his time in teaching tech entrepreneurship to youth attending Mission High School (SFUSD). The program started as an after school pilot after seeing the disparity between the Mission Neighborhood and the Tech ecosystem. Just after one semester, the Youth Startups program turned to a class elective for credit and Jesse along with his brother taught for two semesters by volunteering their time to this important initiative."

I started with Mission Housing in December 2011 as an Asset Manager, then Director of Asset Management and became Executive Director in September 2013. <br><br> I oversee the administration of all Mission Housing assets, programs and services. I also make sure that each and every day our mission, and the short and long term vision for Mission Housing are achieved. Every day is different! I am often in meetings at City Hall and throughout various San Francisco communities pushing for more support of the Affordable Housing industry. On other days, my time at Mission Housing might be spent with issues like human resources, operations, budgets or board meetings. <br><br> Working in Affordable Housing is very rewarding, and I’m very thankful for finding Mission Housing. The most satisfying part of my job is watching our employees represent Mission Housing in the community, interacting with and supporting our residents and our neighbors in the Mission. Since 2012, our staff has grown from eight people to 25 people! Seeing how we can make change for the better is very gratifying. <br><br> I love working on behalf of the current and future residents of the Mission. The people before me who paved the way for Mission Housing sacrificed a great deal. I’m reminded of their hard work whenever I look at one of our 35 buildings, or meet one of our residents."

        I was part of dev Mission’s 4th cohort back in the summer of 2018!<br><br>
        Being part of the program provided me with the exposure to tech fundamentals such as  IoT, Hardware/software curriculum, Intro to Programming & Critical Career Skills.  As a result of the program I was able to: <br><br>
        Disassemble and reassemble a desktop, as well as, identify all of its components. (Hardware/Software curriculum)<br>
        I created a website for my resume (Intro to Programming)<br>
        I created a Nutrition Dictionary web app. (Intro to Programming)<br>  
        Understood how electricity works using a photon kit, which allowed me to set up sensors (photoresistors, temperature, motion) & overall interact with the world via technology. (IoT)<br>
        As well as, to have the opportunity to network with people who work in the tech industry. (Critical Career Skills)
        Having an understanding of how the program ran as a student gives me insight now as a Program Coordinator on how to enhance the program to best meet the needs of participants, simultaneously, complying with the requirements of community partners and funders."
