We were super excited to see 16 Young Adults that graduated from our first joint graduation of 3 spring 2018 cohorts in partnership with the City’s Digital Equity pilot program last Friday @ the Rotunda's City Hall. The three cohorts were from the Mission, Hunters Point East/West, and the Western Addition.

We want to take a moment to acknowledge all the organizations that have supported this program:

The City Administrator’s Office and the SF Committee on Information Technology

Latino Community Foundation

Mayors Office of Housing and Community Development

The Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD)

Microsoft

Mission Housing Development Corporation

Congratulations to all graduates who are now part of the "next generation of tech talent"
